# Word-Blitz-Facebook
A DFS implementation to generate Words for Word Blitz game on Facebook.

Words are generated by running Depth-First Search through the input 4x4 grid and words are matched to English dictionary in `/usr/share/dict/american-english`.

## How to use

* Clone the repository.
* Configure the `max_word_length` and `min_word_length` variables in the first two lines of `blitz.py` as per your need. The higher the value of `max_word_length` the more time it'd take to output the search results.
* Run `python blitz.py`. Run-time is usually less than 0.5 sec for `max_word_length = 6`.
* Input should be 4 letters per line. 4 letters should not be separated by space.
